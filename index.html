        <h1>The Game</h1>
        <p>"Perpetual" is a videogame developed by Vicente Pinho as a college project at the end of the school year of 2021. The game had some principles that he had to follow: The theme of the project was "Wild Nature" and it had be made in Unity and it had to be a 2.5D videogame, although the genre of the game was open to its developer's choice. This was supposed to be a group project but due to its classmates lack of time, Vicente ended up doing the project by himself in the time of approximately one month, which had him choose to develop a point and click <i>"autobiographic"</i> visual novel instead of a side-scroller action game like the previous project.<br><br><i>[insert image here]</i></p>
